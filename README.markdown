# Koji FM #
A web service that generates a playlist of youtube videos based on your last.fm history.

This project was previously written in Ruby on Rails however I am re-writting it in GO so that I can get to know the language.

### ToDo/Wishlist ###
- Add authentication so that views can be scrobbled back to last.fm
- Make it so that playlists can be saved to a user's youtube account
